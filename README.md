From 2019 to 2022, the loyalty program saw significant growth in total sales volume market share, rising from 11% in 2019 to 55% in 2022. Additionally, first-time customer purchases driven by loyalty members increased from 13% to 57% over the same period, highlighting the program's effectiveness in customer acquisition. Repeat business accounted for 70% of total sales volume, and while loyalty members contributed an average of 36% to this segment, their share grew steadily from 12% in 2019 to 38% in 2022, hitting an all time high of 51% in 2021. Adversely, repeat purchase sales volume among non-loyalty members declined from 88% in 2019 to 62% in 2022, reaching an all-time low of 49% in 2021. This suggests that continued investment in acquiring loyalty members could lead to increased repeat business in the long term, while continuing to driving first-time purchases volumn in the present.
