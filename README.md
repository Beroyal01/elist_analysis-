- From 2019 to 2022, the loyalty program saw a significant rise in total sales volume market share, growing from 11% to 55%.
- The program also proved effective for customer acquisition, with first-time purchases driven by loyalty members increasing from 13% to 57% over the same period.
- Repeat business made up 70% of total sales volume, with loyalty members steadily increasing their contribution from 12% in 2019 to 38% in 2022, peaking at 51% in 2021.
- Conversely, repeat purchase sales from non-loyalty members declined from 88% in 2019 to 62% in 2022, hitting a low of 49% in 2021.
- These trends suggest that continued investment in loyalty programs could drive both long-term repeat business and immediate first-time purchases.

- From 2019 to 2022, the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor dominated sales, generating $9.85M (35% of total revenue) with 23,408 orders (22% of total orders).
- Despite ranking second in revenue at $7.73M, the Apple AirPods Headphones stood out as the most popular product by volume, selling 48,402 units (45% of total orders).
- The MacBook Air Laptop followed closely, contributing $6.29M (22% of total revenue), but what sets it apart is its high AOV of $1,588.12, the highest among all products.
- On the other end of the spectrum, the Bose SoundSport Headphones struggled, bringing in only $3,339 from 27 orders, making it the weakest performer.
- The Apple iPhone, while commanding a high AOV of $740.72, saw minimal sales impact with just 288 orders.
- Lower-cost accessories, like the Samsung Charging Cable Pack and Samsung Webcam, proved to be frequent purchases. Though their AOVs were $20.20 and $50.43, they maintained solid order volumes of 21,910 and 7,176, respectively.

## Refund Rates

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37cbfaf0-0b08-4ae7-b92c-dd01cb1a38f4" />

- From 2019 to 2022, refund rates remained stable at an average of 5% of total orders, closely tracking order volume.
- 2022 saw no returns, but it also had the lowest order count of the four years.
- Refund rates followed a seasonal pattern, gradually declining from 6% in January to 5% in December, with the lowest rates (~4%) occurring in Q3.
- Laptops had the highest return rates, with the MacBook Air at 11% and ThinkPad at 12%.
- Loyalty status had minimal impact on refunds, as loyalty members averaged a 5% return rate, compared to 4% for non-loyalty members.
- These trends suggest that seasonality and product category influence refunds more than customer loyalty.

# Recommendations
### Address Sales Decline with Targeted Promotions
- Since sales peaked in 2020 but declined by 46% through 2022, an investigation into external factors such as COVID-19, increased competition, or shifting consumer preferences should be conducted through customer surveys.
- Leverage Q4â€™s consistent strength (~$2.8M in sales, 10,787 orders) by launching aggressive holiday promotions to maximize momentum.
- Introduce limited-time bundles featuring high-performing products like AirPods and MacBooks to counteract the 10% decline in AOV and boost annual revenue.
### Strenghten Loyalty Program for Sustainable Growth
- Given that the loyalty program now accounts for 55% of total sales and first-time loyalty-driven purchases have grown from 13% to 57%, continued investment in program expansion is advised.
- Offer double reward points during historically slow sales periods (Q1 & Q3) to encourage repeat purchases.
### Optimize Product Strategy
- Invest in exclusive deals, extended warranties, or trade-in programs for high-revenue products like Gaming Monitors ($9.85M), AirPods ($7.73M), and MacBooks ($6.29M) to sustain their success.
- Consider increasing ad spend on low-cost, high-volume accessories like Samsung Charging Cables (21,910 orders) and Webcams (7,176 orders) to capitalize on their consistent demand.
- Discontinue or heavily discount underperforming products like Bose SoundSport Headphones ($3,339 in sales, 27 orders) and Apple iPhone (288 orders despite a high AOV of $740.72).
### Improve Order Fulfillment to Reduce Refund Rates
- Since laptops have the highest return rates (MacBook Air at 11%, ThinkPad at 12%), analyze return reasons (e.g., performance issues, defects, unmet expectations) to identify potential improvements.
- Consider implementing restocking fees on high-return items to discourage impulse purchases and reduce unnecessary returns.
- Introduce refurbished discounts to efficiently resell returned laptops and minimize revenue loss.
