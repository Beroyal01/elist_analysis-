ByteCart generated over $28M in sales from 2019 to 2022, with total sales volume experiencing a brief exponential increase of 163%, rising from approximately $3.8M in 2019 to over $10M in 2020. However, from 2020 to 2022, total sales, average order volume, and order count all saw significant declines, with total sales dropping by 46%, AOV decreasing by 10%, and order count falling by 40% in 2022. Despite this decline, each year has seen its highest average total sales of approximately $2.8M, AOV of $271.86 , and order count count of 10,787 in Q4 of the year.



## Loyalty Program

From 2019 to 2022, the loyalty program saw significant growth in total sales volume market share, rising from 11% in 2019 to 55% in 2022. Additionally, first-time customer purchases driven by loyalty members increased from 13% to 57% over the same period, highlighting the program's effectiveness in customer acquisition. Repeat business accounted for 70% of total sales volume, and while loyalty members contributed an average of 36% to this segment, their share grew steadily from 12% in 2019 to 38% in 2022, hitting an all time high of 51% in 2021. Adversely, repeat purchase sales volume among non-loyalty members declined from 88% in 2019 to 62% in 2022, reaching an all-time low of 49% in 2021. This suggests that continued investment in acquiring loyalty members could lead to increased repeat business in the long term, while continuing to driving first-time purchases volumn in the present.

- From 2019 to 2022, the 27in 4K Gaming Monitor dominated sales, generating $9.85M (35% of total revenue) with 23,408 orders (22% of total orders).
- Despite ranking second in revenue at $7.73M, the Apple AirPods Headphones stood out as the most popular product by volume, selling 48,402 units (45% of total orders).
- The MacBook Air Laptop followed closely, contributing $6.29M (22% of total revenue), but what sets it apart is its high AOV of $1,588.12, the highest among all products.
- On the other end of the spectrum, the Bose SoundSport Headphones struggled, bringing in only $3,339 from 27 orders, making it the weakest performer.
- The Apple iPhone, while commanding a high AOV of $740.72, saw minimal sales impact with just 288 orders.
- Lower-cost accessories, like the Samsung Charging Cable Pack and Samsung Webcam, proved to be frequent purchases. Though their AOVs were $20.20 and $50.43, they maintained solid order volumes of 21,910 and 7,176, respectively.

## Refund Rates

<img width="644" alt="image" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/37cbfaf0-0b08-4ae7-b92c-dd01cb1a38f4" />

Refund rates showed minimal fluctuation from 2019 to 2022, except for 2022, which had no returns but the lowest order count. Over the four years, refunds consistently averaged 5% of total orders across all regions, maintaining a proportional relationship with order volume. Each year, refund rates have shown a slight but steady decline from January to December, averaging 6% in January and 5% in December. The lowest rates, around 4%, typically occur in Q3, suggesting a seasonal correlation between refund rates and time of year. Among total refunds, laptops saw the highest return rate with the Macbook Air seeing a 11% return rate and ThinkPad at 12%. The difference in refund rates between loyalty and non-loyalty members was minimal over the four years, with non-loyalty members averaging 4% and loyalty members 5%. This suggests that the loyalty program has little impact on refund rates.

# Recommendations
### Address Sales Decline with Targeted Promotions
- Since sales peaked in 2020 but declined through 2022, investigation into external factors such as Covid, competition, or changin consumer preferences through customer surveys should be performed.
- Leverage of Q4 as the strongest sales period should be utilized by launching aggressive holiday promotions to maximize momentum.
- Introduction of limited-time bundles featuring high performing products like Airpods bundled with MacBooks to boost yearly AOV decline.
### Strenghten Loyalty Program for Sustainable Growth
- Continual investment into loyalty program expansion should be looked into due to now contributing 55% of total sales, and first time loyalty driven purchases growing to 57%.
- Offer double reward points during historically slow sales periods like Q1 and Q3 to encourage repeat purchases.
### Optimize Product Strategy
- Invest in exclusive deals, extended warranties, or trade-in programs to maintain sales volume for revenue dominating products like Gaming Monitors, Airpods, and MacBooks.
- Consider increasing ad spend on low cost accessories driving order volumn like Samsung Charging Cables and Webcams.
- Discontinue or heavily discount underperforming products like the Bose SoundSport Headphones and Apple Iphone.
### Improve Order Fulfillment to Reduce Refund Rates
- Analyze return reasons (performance issues, defects, unmet expectations) for laptops due to highest return rate of 11-12%.
- Consider charging restocking fees on high return items to discourage impulse purchases.
- Provide refurbished discounts to resell returned laptops efficently.
